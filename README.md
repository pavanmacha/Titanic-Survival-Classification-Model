libraries used are :
             ->Pandas  : for importing the data and claening the data of junk and nullvalues
             ->Numpy   : used for mathmetical caluclations and creating for genrationg the randomvalues
             ->Matplotlib : used to set the figuresize, labels and titles for graphs
             ->seaborn  : used forr advance plots to visualize the data ex: distplot , countplot etc...
             ->sklearn  : this library consists of whole models and accuracy checkers and also standardzing the traing dataset
